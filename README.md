### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on FundaciÃ³n Lomas Travel like an accountant in the finance industry.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning coding an a programattion of web pages and machine learning with python, only to be hobbies like a dumb but it's okey, because I have a lot of uses fot that, or a I think so. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on an app with python or to learn about programming togheter, because a I have regrets by myself to don't learn more about that. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with the programming and to plan and thing about myself like the another level, and create and mark for myself. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Contability issues, like taxes and the correct money fluents, I guess to that I could resolve some of you questions about it. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Nobody wants to follow me on IG but it's @ChrisMT, I don't have twitter and reddit more, because I think that disconected me for the life I don't want that. 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him or with recorts of my name like: Chris
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am so afraid by myself and I so anxiety when someone talks me, because I don't have a lot of experience talking with people, and I almost getting away from my deepest hole.
